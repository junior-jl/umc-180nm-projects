# NOT Gate Project

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a NOT gate using the UMC 180nm process.

## Description

The NOT gate is a fundamental logic gate that performs the logical operation of negation. It has one input and one output, where the output is the logical complement of the input.

## Design Specifications

- Feed Voltage: 1.8V

## Simulation Results

The simulation results for the NOT gate design are presented below:
