 Project

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA) using the UMC 180nm process.

## Description

The LNA is designed to operate in the frequency range of 2.38 - 2.42 GHz with a minimum gain of 10 dB. It aims to achieve a return loss of less than -10 dB, a noise figure below 10 dB, and a Q value of LRC less than 10. The LNA operates with a power supply voltage (Vdd) of 1.8V and has an output impedance of 5 kohms.
